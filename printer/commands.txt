pacman -S --needed base-devel mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain

Add Compiler to PATH: This is crucial so you can use the compiler from VS Code's terminal or a regular Command Prompt.
Find the MinGW-w64 bin directory. If you installed MSYS2 to C:\msys64, this will likely be C:\msys64\mingw64\bin.
Add this directory to your Windows Environment Variables PATH:
Search for "Environment Variables" in the Windows search bar and select "Edit the system environment variables".
Click the "Environment Variables..." button.
Under "System variables" (or "User variables" if you only want it for your user), find the Path variable, select it, and click "Edit...".
Click "New" and paste the path (e.g., C:\msys64\mingw64\bin).
Click OK on all the dialogs.
You might need to close and reopen VS Code or any open terminals for the PATH change to take effect.
Verify Installation: Open a new Command Prompt or VS Code terminal and type:
gcc --version


make sure these files are present:

ConsumerPrnDevDLL.dll
FontCfg.ini
GRGDTATM_CommCfg.ini


gcc main.c -o printer_test.exe
